👋 Hi, I’m Mahdi — a Frontend Developer with 7+ years of experience, specialized in building **modern e-commerce solutions**.

I focus on creating **high-performance**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly storefronts** that help businesses grow.

Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with platforms like **Magento** and **Shopify**, as well as **headless commerce** using **Next.js**, **Remix.js**, **Hydrogen**, and **React.js**.  
I combine these with technologies like **GraphQL**, **Apollo Client**, and **SCSS modules** to deliver seamless, optimized, and maintainable solutions.

🚀 **My expertise includes:**
- 🛒 **E-commerce platforms:** Magento, Shopify (themes + headless)
- ⚛️ **Modern frontend:** Next.js, React.js, Remix.js, Hydrogen
- 🔗 **APIs & data handling:** GraphQL, Apollo Client, REST APIs
- 🎨 **Styling & architecture:** SCSS modules, BEM methodology, responsive design
- ⚡ **Performance, accessibility, and cross-platform optimization**

I’m passionate about building **conversion-focused storefronts** with **clean architecture**, **reusable components**, and **excellent user experiences**.  
Beyond coding, I enjoy solving business challenges with technology, mentoring teams, and staying up-to-date with the latest in **frontend** and **commerce tech**.

If you’re working on **e-commerce projects** and need someone who can bridge **design, development, and performance**, I’d love to connect.
