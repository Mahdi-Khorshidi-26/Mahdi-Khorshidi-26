I’m a Frontend Developer with 7+ years of experience, specialized in building modern e-commerce solutions. My focus is on creating high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly storefronts that help businesses grow.

Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with platforms like Magento and Shopify, as well as headless commerce using Remix.js, Hydrogen, and React.js. I combine these with technologies like GraphQL, Apollo Client, and SCSS modules to deliver seamless, optimized, and maintainable solutions.

🚀 My expertise includes:

E-commerce platforms: Magento, Shopify (themes + headless)

Modern frontend: React.js, Remix.js, Hydrogen

APIs & data handling: GraphQL, Apollo Client, REST APIs

Styling & architecture: SCSS modules, BEM methodology, responsive design

Performance, accessibility, and cross-platform optimization

I’m passionate about building conversion-focused storefronts with clean architecture, reusable components, and excellent user experiences. Beyond coding, I enjoy solving business challenges with technology, mentoring teams, and staying on top of the latest in frontend and commerce tech.

If you’re working on e-commerce projects and need someone who can bridge design, development, and performance, I’d be glad to connect.
